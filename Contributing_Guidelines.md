# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to Gym-Junkies! Please take a moment to review the guidelines below before making a contribution.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes and commit them with a clear message explaining what you did.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Submit a pull request to the main repository.

## Fork the repository
This creates a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account. You can do this by clicking the `fork` button on the original repository's page.

## Clone the repository to your local machine
To work on the code locally, you need to download a copy of the code from your forked repository to your own computer. This can be done using the `git clone` command in your terminal/command prompt.

## Create a new branch for your changes
This is important so that you can work on your changes separately from the original code. You can create a new branch using the `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>` command.

## Make your changes and commit them with a clear message explaining what you did
This is where you can make your changes to the code. Once you're done, you need to commit your changes using the git commit command with a clear message explaining what you did.

## Push your changes to your forked repository
Once you have committed your changes locally, you need to push them back to your forked repository on GitHub using the `git push` command.

## Submit a pull request to the main repository
This is where you let the original repository owner know that you have made some changes and would like them to consider adding your changes to the original codebase. You can do this by submitting a pull request on GitHub, explaining what changes you made and why they should be considered.

## Note
Deleting the forked repository after the pull request has been merged will not affect your contribution or your commit and pull request history. However, it is generally a good idea to keep your forked repository for future contributions or for reference.

Thank you for considering making your first contribution to this project!
